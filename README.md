# Description
Over the years I have found myself silently contributing to the nanorc syntax highlighting packages, they constantly have bugs in the regular expressions or at times clear performance issues. Furthermore I often want additions to the default colors. Right now I'm working with javascript so I will upload that file, but I have one custom ones for perl, bash, coffeescript, css, html, php, and json that I will upload on request or as I visit that code.

# Instalation
Simple copy over the files into the folder for nanorc syntax coloring files. For you this is porbably `/usr/share/nano/` for me this is `/usr/local/share/nanorc/`
